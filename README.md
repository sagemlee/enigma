* Functionality: 3 The enigma class runs encrypt and decrypt methods successfully. Encrypt/decrypt also work on the CLI.
* Object Oriented Programming:3, I believe my code is broken up into logical components. I do only have two classes. I tried to break it up into more, but I thought that made my code even more confusing. I didnt want to break things up just for the sake of it.
* Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 3, I think my code looks good design wise, I have used multiple hashes and I believe I used efficient enumerables. I would not give myself a 4 because there are methods in my shift class that have more than 10 lines.
* Test Driven Development: 3, every method has been tested. However I didnt use mocks or stubs
* Version Control: 3, the only reason I wouldnt say 4, is that some of my commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
